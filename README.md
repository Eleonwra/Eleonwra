## 👋 Hi, I'm Eleonora
I am a **Mathematician** transitioning into **Machine Learning Engineering**, leveraging mathematical intuition to engineer high-performance, deployment-ready AI.

### Current Focus
* **Bridging to Computer Science**: Transitioning my mathematical background into the CS domain by mastering Version Control (Git/GitHub) and refactoring research code into modular, professional software.
* **Portfolio Refactoring**: Organizing my projects into clean, reproducible repositories that follow industry standards.

## 📈 The Goal:

To bring a mathematician’s perspective to a technical team. I aim to move beyond just "applying models" by understanding the why behind them to drive innovative solutions. My objective is to combine deep analytical thinking with solid CS foundations to build reliable, high-impact data systems.
